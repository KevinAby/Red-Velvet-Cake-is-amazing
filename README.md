Tips
 
  . Measure your flour correctly! Adding too much flour to the recipe is the most common mistake. The best, and easiest way to measure flour is by using a scale. If you don’t have one then fluff your flour with a spoon, sprinkle it into your measuring cup, and use a knife to level it off.

   . If you’re not using 6-inch pans, double the recipe for 8-inch pans or triple the recipe for 9-inch pans.

  .Skip the food coloring if you want a great tasting cake that isn’t red.

   .For nice uniform crumbs for decorating use the fine grater, or just whip out that

   This cake is a delicious one. I doubt will it last more than 2 days. Happy Baking!

   Ps. This cake is best eaten chilled so always freeze it before enjoying it.
